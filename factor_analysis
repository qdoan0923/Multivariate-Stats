WB <- read.csv("/Users/quintdoan/Documents/Yale/Spring 2021/Multivariate/Edited_Data.csv", header = T, as.is = F)

rownames(WB) <- WB[, 1]	

#Create a column that shows if something is extinct or endangered
WB$Extinct=2*(WB$Extinct)
#Create a column that shows if something is extinct or endangered
#There is not enough of these points to define a 12 dimensional space

# For starters, let's look at whether our data will work well for factor analysis.  We'll calculate correlations, look at a correlation plot, and get the KMO metric.	

# Here are the correlations.	

#Examine raw correlations	
round(cor(WB3),2)	

#Get correlation plot	
corrplot.mixed(cor(WB3), lower.col = "black", upper = "ellipse", tl.col = "black", number.cex = .7, tl.pos = "lt", tl.cex = .7, p.mat = cor.mtest(WB2, conf.level = .95)$p, sig.level = .05)	


# Interestingly, log(imports) is only really related to log(exports).  We could consider removing this indicator from our analysis.  Other indicators are highly correlated (which is good).	

# Let's get KMO.	


#This uses the paf() function in the rela package - more on this below	
paf(as.matrix(WB3))$KMO	

# KMO is quite high which is good.	

# #### Factor Analysis using Maximum Likelihood (only option in factanal).	

# We also do a Varimax Rotation.  This uses the factanal() function.	


#try 2 factor solution	
fact0 <- factanal(WB3, factors = 2, rotation = "varimax")

#try 3 factor solution

#get reproduced correlation matrix

#get proportion of residuals greater than 0.05 in absolute value

#this uses the fa() function in the psych package.  Note that this fails with only 2 factors	
fact2 <- fa(WB3, nfactors = 3, rotate = "varimax", fm = "pa")

# Loading plot for first two factors

# #### Perform Factor Analysis using iterative PCA with Varimax Rotation	

# Again, we use the fa() function	


fact3 <- fa(WB3, nfactors = 3, rotate = "varimax", SMC = FALSE, fm = "pa")
